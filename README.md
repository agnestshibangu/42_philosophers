# Philosophers

**Philosophers** is a project from the 42 curriculum that focuses on solving the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem**. The challenge lies in implementing concurrent processes or threads while avoiding deadlocks, starvation, and race conditions.

---

## üìù Project Description

The project simulates a group of philosophers sitting around a table, where:
- Each philosopher alternates between **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**.
- There are as many forks as there are philosophers, and each philosopher needs **two forks** to eat.
- The program ensures that all philosophers follow these rules:
  - A philosopher can only eat if they can pick up both forks (one on their left and one on their right).
  - After eating, the philosopher puts down both forks and goes to sleep before starting to think again.
  - If a philosopher doesn‚Äôt eat within a certain time limit, they die.

The goal is to prevent deadlocks and ensure proper synchronization between threads or processes.
